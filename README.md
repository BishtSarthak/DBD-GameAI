Writing code to play Dead By Daylight

## Disclaimer
- [Dead By Daylight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight) is a trademark of [Behaviour Interactive Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_Interactive)
- Neither this project nor its developer is in anyway associated with Behaviour Interactive Inc.
- This project is just a proof-of-concept. Please do NOT use it in competitive games.

## Dependencies
Should also work with slightly older versions of the following (to be tested)
- Python v3.11
- OpenCV v4.6
- Numpy v1.25
- Pywin32 v305

## Note
- Just run ```src/main.py``` while DeadByDaylight game window is also running.
- Currently, the program only performs (mostly Great, but sometimes Good) Skill Checks automatically.
- Tested Skill Checks for Generator, Healing and Wiggle.
- Yet to test with Merciless Storm continuous Skill Checks.
